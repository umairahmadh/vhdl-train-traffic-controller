 # This report contains names of design units along with parameter
 # values and self instances.
 # Some parameters may have more than one possible values for that
 # design unit, values will be unique for instances. It is indicated as
 # "Multiple Values".
 # In some cases instance count shown may be less than actual instance
 # count in the design due to optimizations. It is indicated as
 # "Optimized".
